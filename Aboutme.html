    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello My Name is Justice and my major is emerging media specifically in Gaming Design and Interactive Media concentration at city tech . I am 18 years old and i enjoy working and saving money , so that i can better prepare for my future after college. Some of the skills and hobbies that i have is speaking 4 languages,knowing how to create a circuit board,graphic designing, and investing into the stock market .
    <h2>Goal's</h2>
    <p> Setting Goals in life is so important for every single individual who wants to succeed in life . My goal is quite long but hopefully by my determination and grit i will acheive them. providing my mom with a better home and giving to others is one of my top priorites. Giving and helping others helps the world heal ,so a goal of mines in the near future  would be traveling across the world in places like africa, pakistan, iraq, albaina and etc. While Accomplishing this goal of mines i hope that other people will follow my path to help and donate to the poor.
    This goal is significant to my life because I would like my mom to quit her job and relax. My mom is the one of the most hardworking women I know in my life no one that i know works harder than her.
    Hope fully this major that iam in gets me a good job , so that i could make my thoughtful miracles come to life.
    I will achieve this goal in my 4th year of college 9 / 7 / 24. One quote that i always like saying to people who feel doubtful and unlucky comes from one of the greats who had goals and made them into reality. That person is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He once said that "If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward."</p>
